13	http://cityplanning.lacity.org/CPU/hollywood/Maps/hwd_GenPlan.pdf	The Plan contemplates that certain commercial uses may be allowed on properties designated as High density through LAMC 12.24.C5(j). Commercial uses should be limited to those permitted in the C1 zone and the FAR of such uses should not exceed 1:1.

17	http://cityplanning.lacity.org/CPU/hollywood/Maps/hwd_GenPlan.pdf	For existing mobilehome parks, the existing use and the RMP Zone are consistent with the Plan, and the RMP zone is a corresponding zone for every land use designation in the Plan, including residential, commercial, and industrial Plan designations. The retention or expansion of existing mobilehome parks in the RMP Zone encourages the provision of affordable housing and serves as a viable resource to supplement the City's housing stock. New mobilehome parks shall be consistent with the Plan when developed in the RMP Zone and in a Residential or Commercial Plan designation. The RMP zone is a corresponding zone for every residential and commercial land use designation in the Plan. New mobilehome parks should be established such that their location is: 1) desirable to public convenience and welfare: 2) in harmony with the various elements and objectives of the General Plan: 3) proper in relation to adjacent uses or development; and 4) not materially detrimental to the character of development in the immediate neighborhood.	20140402
18	http://cityplanning.lacity.org/CPU/hollywood/Maps/hwd_GenPlan.pdf	Each Plan category permits all indicated corresponding zones as well as those zoned referenced in the LAMC as permitted by such zones unless further restricted by adopted Specific Plans, specific conditions and/or limitations of project approval, plan footnotes or other Plan map or text notations. Zones established in the LAMC subsequent to the adoption of the Plan shall not be deemed as corresponding to any particular Plan category unless the Plan is amended to so indicate. It is the intent of the Plan that the entitlements granted shall be one of the zone designations within the corresponding zones shown on the Plan unless accompanied by a concurrent Plan Amendment.	20140402
19	http://cityplanning.lacity.org/CPU/hollywood/Maps/hwd_GenPlan.pdf	The Public Facility (PF) planning land use designation is premised on the ownership and use of the property by a government agency. The designation of the PF Zone as a corresponding zone is based on the same premise. The Plan also intends that when a board or governing body of a governing agency officially determines that a property zone PF is surplus, and no other public agency has indicated an intent to acquire, and the City is notified that the agency intends to offer the property for sale to a private purchaser, then the property may be rezoned to the zone(s) most consistent within 500 feet of the property boundary and still be considered consistent with the adopted Plan.	20140402
